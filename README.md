# RoomSampleApp

This work is presented by Alberto Gonzalez
For the EBU CP307 Class
Professor Jack Siro

# Overview
This is a sample app made by following the Android Room with a View - Java codelab to build a simple app using Room database to manage records
I worked with:

DAO (data access object) 

LiveData class

Room database

Repository

ViewModel

XML layout

RecyclerView

To transfer the project to GitHub i used command line(CMD) and the functions for GIT in Android Studio, as Add, Commit and Push


This is the readme for this app, it saves words and arrange them in a list as you can see in these screenshots
