# Overview
This is a sample app that saves with the Help of Room database, simple notes in an app. It is made by following the Android Room with a View - Java codelab 
to build a simple app using Room database to manage records

I worked with:

DAO (data access object) 

LiveData class

Room database

Repository

ViewModel

XML layout

RecyclerView

To transfer the project to GitHub i used command line(CMD) and the functions for GIT in Android Studio, as Add, Commit and Push

It is in a Branch named Main, and it is other version from the first version,that is in the Master branch

This is the readme for this app, it saves words and arrange them in a list as you can see in these screenshots
